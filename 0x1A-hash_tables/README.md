# Hash Tables

-> uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects
* use of this for student info retrieval based on std id
* retrieving book info based on unique number assigned to books

In both these examples the students and books were hashed to a unique number

hash = hashfunc(key)
index = hash % array_size

A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs
* to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted/searched
